# Privacy Policy for CloudSync

**Last Updated:** May 11, 2025

This privacy policy describes how the open-source game mod/app "CloudSync" (hereinafter referred to as "the Software") interacts with your data.

**Data Collection:**

CloudSync **does not collect any personal information** from you directly. This means we do not track your usage, store your game data, or gather any details about your device or identity.

**Use of Third-Party Services:**

CloudSync utilizes third-party cloud storage services to enable its core functionality, which is to synchronize game data. These services include, but may not be limited to:

* **Google Drive:** CloudSync may interact with your Google Drive account to store and retrieve game data that you explicitly choose to synchronize.
    * You can review Google's privacy policy here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* **Dropbox:** CloudSync may interact with your Dropbox account to store and retrieve game data that you explicitly choose to synchronize.
    * You can review Dropbox's privacy policy here: [https://www.dropbox.com/privacy](https://www.dropbox.com/privacy)

**Data Handling by Third-Party Services:**

Please be aware that when you choose to use CloudSync with a third-party cloud storage service, your game data will be stored on their servers and will be subject to their respective privacy policies and terms of service. We have no control over how these third-party services collect, use, and protect your data.

**Your Choices:**

* You have the choice of which third-party cloud storage service you use with CloudSync, if any.
* You have control over the game data you choose to synchronize using CloudSync. You can choose to stop synchronization or delete the data from your chosen cloud storage service directly through their respective platforms.

**Security:**

As CloudSync does not directly collect or store your personal data, we do not maintain separate security measures for user data within the Software itself. The security of your game data is primarily governed by the security measures implemented by the third-party cloud storage service you choose to use. We recommend reviewing their security practices.

**Children's Privacy:**

CloudSync does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has used CloudSync and their data is being stored by a third-party service without your consent, please contact the respective third-party service provider as outlined in their privacy policies.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy:**

As CloudSync is an open-source project and its development is ongoing, this privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

**Contact:**

For any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please feel free to reach out through the project's open-source channels (e.g., issue trackers, forums).

**By using CloudSync, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the privacy policies of the third-party services you choose to utilize.**
